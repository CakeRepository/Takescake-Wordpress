About me

I've been what I like to call a "Passionate Technologist" for as long as I can remember. But to hopefully bring some validity to what I hope to convey I started working at Geek Squad around 8 years ago. From there I moved to a Managed Service provider and have worked anywhere from my printer won't print to building, architecting, and deploying custom solutions in Azure. I have found my focus slows has migrated more and more to writing "Scripts" or automated fixes in multiple systems mainly Microsoft. 
I've also leaned on it for making this website I've moved from not being on google when Searching Takescake to being listed at the top. Obviously more goes into it than that, but there are many widgets/games I plan to get implemented here close to 100% written by AI. 

I enjoy technology and really am excited to share information that will show you some of the value I've found from these tools.
